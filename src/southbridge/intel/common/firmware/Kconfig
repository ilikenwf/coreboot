	  The Intel processor in the selected system requires a special firmware
	  for an integrated controller called Management Engine (ME). The ME
	  firmware might be provided in coreboot's 3rdparty/blobs repository. If
	  not and if you don't have the firmware elsewhere, you can still
	  build coreboot without it. In this case however, you'll have to make
	  sure that you don't overwrite your ME firmware on your flash ROM.

	string "Path to management engine firmware"

##### Fake IFD #####

config BUILD_WITH_FAKE_IFD
	bool "Build with a fake IFD" if !HAVE_IFD_BIN
	help
	  If you don't have an Intel Firmware Descriptor (descriptor.bin) for your
	  board, you can select this option and coreboot will build without it.
	  The resulting coreboot.rom will not contain all parts required
	  to get coreboot running on your board. You can however write only the
	  BIOS section to your board's flash ROM and keep the other sections
	  untouched. Unfortunately the current version of flashrom doesn't
	  support this yet. But there is a patch pending [1].

	  WARNING: Never write a complete coreboot.rom to your flash ROM if it
	           was built with a fake IFD. It just won't work.
